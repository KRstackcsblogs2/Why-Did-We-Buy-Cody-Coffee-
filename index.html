                <h1>Why Did We Buy Cody Coffee?</h1>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Cody Coffee, a small batch roaster, located near Yellowstone National Park. I recently bought this small business with my business partner who also happens to be my wife. We absolutely have other responsibilities and rely heavily on the team that surrounds us. This is a fun adventure that keeps us connected to our local hometown of Cody, WY. Now, everyone is asking why did we invest in the coffee industry.</span></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><span>From the earliest days I can remember, I loved coffee. Well … that is not necessarily true. Every time, I went to my grandfather’s house (My Hero), He would serve me black coffee. There were no options for cream, sugar, or flavor just strait black coffee. For a few adolescent years, I choked down the product just so my grandpa would respect me the way that I respected him. I never dared to ask for any product to mix with it and I’d like to mention that he didn’t spend much extra coin for quality coffee beans. My grandpa was my best friend, and we drank coffee together.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Fast forwarding to my teenage years, I was a seasoned black coffee drinker. I drank it with my dad, at church events, on my way to work, in hotel lobbies, from gas stations, and of course, with my grandpa. It had become the norm in my life and an important part of my morning routine.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Now, I am 43 years old. I have been married for 20 years to Heidi Robinson, and I have three children, Tucker, 17, Tristan, 15, and Taren, 10. We have a beautiful life and live on a nice hay farm and horse property with mountain views of the greater Yellowstone area near Cody, WY. I have now lived in this area since I was 17 years old. I sell real estate, ranch and recreational, with Fay Ranches and my wife takes care of residential clients. We are blessed and appreciate the life we have and the area we call home. However, as we invested in the future, my wife and I thought that we were becoming more disconnected from our favorite town, Cody, WY. The kids watch all manner of information on their cell phones about entrepreneurship and have an interest in pursuing the rewarding but oh so difficult life of self-employment. So, what was our next move for the family? Let’s buy Cody Coffee! We have been called crazy. We have been asked if this was a mid-life crisis. We have even been told there are easier ways to invest money (we know). The reality is …. I still drink coffee, lots of it, arguably too much. The only difference is grandpa is no longer with me, so I am tasked with teaching others a fine appreciation for coffee. I will take on this task because it was taught to me by my hero.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>People come to coffee shops for different reasons. They rekindle old flames, talk religion, create business plans, and even creep on our baristas. However, to know why we go to coffee shops and why we bought Cody Coffee, you first must understand me and my family.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>We are on a mission to ….</span></p>
